This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project created to shame Trent for being godawful at fantasy football.

## Getting Started
The simplest way to get started is seriously with codespaces, like stupid easy. start a code space, run ```npm run dev``` in the terminal, click the [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) link that gets spit out, and start editing!

-----
First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
